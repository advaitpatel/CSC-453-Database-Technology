<p>All materials are in D2L.</p>

<p>There are three exams but only the highest two exam scores count towards your grade.</p>

<p><b>A makeup will <u>NOT</u> be offered for a missed exam.</b></p>

<p><b>Late assignments are <u>NOT</u> accepted</b>. Mac users - be sure to submit a PC formatted document.<br />
Assignments are due at the beginning of class.<br />
Late assignments will receive a grade of zero. The lowest assignment grade will be dropped.</p>

<p>Assignments must be submitted via D2L: email, diskettes, CDs, printouts, flash/jump drives, etc., will not be accepted.</p>

<p>There are no group homework assignments; you are expected to do your own work.</p>

<p>Incompletes are <u>rarely</u> given.</p>

<p>Instructions for accessing your CDM Oracle account will be posted in D2L.<br />
In addition to the University computer labs, you also have access to the additional CDM computer labs, both downtown at 243 S. Wabash and in Room 363 of the Student Center.<br />
If you are not a CDM major, to use the PCs in a CDM lab you must activate your CDM account beforehand by logging into <a href="https://accountactivate.cdm.depaul.edu">https://accountactivate.cdm.depaul.edu</a>.</p>
