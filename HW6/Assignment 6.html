<p><b>Assignment 6</b></p>

<p>Assignment 6 is a modification of Assignment 5:<ul>
	<li>Modify Step 1 of Assignment 5 to use vendors6 and invoices6.<br/><br/></li>
	<li>Modify Step 1 of Assignment 5 to delete vendor 101 from vendors6.<br/><br/></li>
	<li>After the code for Step 1 and prior to the code for Step 2:<br/><br/><ul>
		<li>Use EXECUTE IMMEDIATE to create a function which accepts 3 number parameters and returns the first parameter minus the sum of the other two.<br/><br/></li>
		<li>Use EXECUTE IMMEDIATE to create a before insert/update trigger on invoices6 which invokes the function to set the balance due.<br/><br/></li></ul></li>
	<li>Modify Step 2 of Assignment 5, changing the credit taken to 15%, and deleting the hard-coded amounts for the balance due on the rows inserted into invoices6.<br/><br/></li>
	<li>Modify Step 3 of Assignment 5 to drop additional objects as needed to ensure that the database is restored to the initial state.<br/><br/></li>
</ul></p>

<p> Note that &quot;to create&quot; means that &quot;CREATE ... END&quot; are all part of the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement string constant, as shown in class.</p>

<p>As Assignment 6 is a modification of Assignment 5 all unmodified steps of Assignment 5 are still required.</p>

<p>Again, all of your code can be in one block if you prefer, but <b>all of it should be executable from one copy &amp; paste into SQL Developer</b>.</p>

<p>Post your solution (SQL and output) in D2L.</p>
