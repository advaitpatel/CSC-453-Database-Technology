As mentioned during class, none of the Assignment 4 questions should generate more than a dozen rows of output.

I just changed the range in Question 5 to 16 months.

When pasting data, simply use a fixed-space font (e.g. Courier) so that the columns align properly.

Screen shots must include all output, both rows & columns, and not be reduced in size.

When warranted, column formatting should be included with each problem. Do not depend on formatting from previous problems as then it won't be formatted when I execute it.

Use formatting so that the output is not spread across more than a couple of lines. Do not just use a tiny font that is barely readable.

If posting a PDF, verify that it is searchable, that is, ensure that I can copy & paste the SQL. I should not have to rekey the SQL.

All currency values should have dollar signs and comma separators.

Do not modify any of the objects and, if you create any objects, include code to remove them.

Zero credit may be given if the output does not match the SQL.
